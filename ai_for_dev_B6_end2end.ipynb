We allocate functions to many services and use Azure services to deploy. I usually work on portal and azure CLI to manage service like App service, Function app, Storage account, cosmos DB, API management and so on. We are building docker images for our services which is as needed to set up kubernetes. Frameworks I used is Django, NestJS, NodeJS to provice API. In django, I also read data from excels fiel by pandas and numpy. Reactjs is Frontend framework and React native is used on mobile. linksinternational.com → 2022 SmartQA Project Python Developer I take part in building project based of serverless architecture. The project has functions like trello with manage tasks, assign to member and so on. The project use AWS services such as: lambda function, SES, Route53, DynamoBD, IotCore, S3, etc...
